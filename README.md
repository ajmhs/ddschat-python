# ddschat-python
DDSChat implementation in Python

I've been looking at the System Designer and as part of that I was following the Academy Course 
"Writing a Connext Chat Application using Connector and Python" found at
https://www.rtiacademy.com/learn/course/58/play/284/introduction

As I'm not using Connector, I'm following along but using the Python API and making adjustments/learning as I go. 

This is the application as I wrote it, there may be a better way of handling the threading - so when I find some time I might revisit it.
